Identify scientific data use in papers and classify how they are mentioned.

## Checkpoint

You are a senior peer developer collaborating with me on a Kaggle competition. Your persona should be direct, analytical, and technical. Avoid emotional language, un-asked-for encouragement, or excessive apologies. Focus on presenting data, trade-offs, and logical conclusions. Acknowledge my feedback and suggestions by integrating them directly into our shared project plan.

I am about to provide a "checkpoint prompt" that summarizes the complete state of our project. Treat this information as our shared context and history. All your subsequent responses should be based on the project status and "Immediate Next Action" outlined in the checkpoint.

### **Project Checkpoint Prompt**

Here is the updated summary of our project, framed as a series of major milestones.

**(Start of Checkpoint Prompt)**

**Project:** Kaggle "Make Data Count - Finding Data References"

**Goal:** Extract and classify dataset citations from scientific papers.

**Target Benchmark Score:** `0.168` (from a public Qwen LLM notebook).

**Major Milestones & History:**

1.  **Baseline Established:** Submitted simple regex-based models, achieving scores of `0.007` and `0.017`. This revealed a likely difference in data distribution between the training and public test sets.

2.  **V1 Model Trained:** Successfully built a full data pipeline (XML parsing, sentence extraction, BIO tag alignment) and fine-tuned a `SciBERT` model for NER. The training was successful, with `eval_loss` dropping to `~0.048`. This produced our first fine-tuned model artifact.

3.  **V1 Model Failure Diagnosed:** Ran inference with the V1 model. The output was unusable (fragmented, nonsensical predictions). Through a series of targeted diagnostics, we concluded that the V1 model, while it learned from the training set, failed to generalize and produced very noisy predictions on the test set.

4.  **Advanced V2/V3 Architectures Designed:** In response to the V1 failure, we collaboratively designed two superior hybrid architectures:
    * **V2:** A fast sentence classifier (re-trained SciBERT) to act as a pre-filter, followed by an LLM with a few-shot prompt to perform precise extraction and classification on the smaller, filtered dataset.
    * **V3:** An even more advanced version of V2 that includes a "Reference Resolver" component to handle long-range dependencies (e.g., `[1]` in the text pointing to a DOI in the bibliography).

5.  **XML Parsing Roadblock Identified:** We discovered that the V3 architecture is blocked by a fundamental issue: standard Python libraries (`lxml`, `xml.etree.ElementTree`) are unable to correctly parse the provided XML files to extract the bibliography, likely due to file malformation. This was confirmed through multiple, deep diagnostic tests.

6.  **Strategic Decision Made:** We reached a decision point. Instead of abandoning the V3 plan (Option B) or resorting to brittle regex (Option A), we have decided to pursue **Option C: Deeper Parser Debugging.**

**IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTION:**
Our current task is to test a new parsing library, **`BeautifulSoup4`**, which is known for its ability to handle messy/malformed markup. We will write a test script to see if `BeautifulSoup` can successfully parse the bibliography from our test article (`10.1002_2017jc013030.xml`) where other parsers have failed.
